<div class="">
    <h1>First time connecting</h1>

    <p>So you’ve managed to get the launcher working and you’re unsure what to do now. You click
        “PubNE1” on the left of the launcher. Then click Launch. This will put you into the launcher
        queue. You have to wait through the queue. The time in queue can vary depending on day and time.
        For possible guesses on how long it may take. Ask in the public discords “Queue-complaining”
        section. While you’re in the queue you get the option to have “Auto-launch” selected or not. If
        you have it selected it will auto launch FiveM when you’re ready to join the server. If not; you
        will get a notice on the launcher saying “Your golden ticket is ready.” When this prompt
        shows.<br>
        You get 5 minutes to click launch. </p>
