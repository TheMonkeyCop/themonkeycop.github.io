<div class="">
    <h1>Launcher wants to download FiveM again</h1>
    <br>
    <p>So, you managed to download the launcher and log in but you get a prompt to download FiveM even
        though you already have it. <br>
        Click continue and allow it to download. <br>
        TheFamilyRP have their own version of the FiveM client. You will not be able to join server
        unless you accept the download.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> Make sure you have exceptions in your anti-virus and Windows defender. It's common
        for them to capture FiveM files.
