<div class="">
    <h1>Logging into the launcher </h1>
    <br>
    <p>When you’ve downloaded TheFamilyRP launcher. You will be asked to log into the launcher. <br>
        The details you use to log in will be your forum username and password. Before logging into the
        launcher make sure you have linked your steam and discord on the forum and that your forum
        profile shows the “validated” tag. If it doesn’t you will not be able to log into the launcher.
        <br>If you attempt to log into the launcher too many times with an invalid password the launcher
        will lock you out for 1 hour from the last attempt. If you try to connect and feel your password
        is incorrect, it may be better for you to reset it. <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If you have special characters in your forum name you may not be able to log into
        the launcher.</p>
