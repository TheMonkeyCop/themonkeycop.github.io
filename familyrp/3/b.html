<div class="">
    <h1>My time in queue is not changing </h1>
    <p>This is something that happens.<br>
        Firstly - Check the public discord. If the server is down, don’t worry about it. <br>
        If the server has just gone back up. If it a minute of two for it to catch back up. Your time
        should resume. <br>
        If you find the server wasn’t down or your time didn’t continue after the server coming back up.
        You need to restart the launcher. It is possible your launcher froze. <br>
        Waiting in queue isn’t going to do anything but waste your own time. You’ll have to restart and
        possibly end up at the end again unfortunately - You also won’t be relocated to your position.
        It happens to many people and something that can’t be prevented. </p>
