<div class="">
    <h1>I got AFK kicked from the server </h1>
    <p>This is your own fault. <br>
        The AFK timer is a system that is in place to remove AFK people from the server. Allowing others
        who are available to connect to the server if you’re busy. If you get AFK kicked you’re going to
        be put to the back of the queue. Don’t do it. </p>
