<div class="">
    <h1>I disconnected, can I reconnect? </h1>
    <p>If you lost connection or you closed out to change character or any other reason and need to reconnect, you get a grace time to reconnect. <br>
        The grace reconnect time is 3 minutes for those who are in server. <br>
        The grace time for those who was in queue and closed launcher is 10 minutes. <br>
        If you go on the launcher and click remove grace. You will no longer have them grace times to reconnect. You will go back to the end of the queue. <br>
