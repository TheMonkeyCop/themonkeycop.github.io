<div class="">
    <h1>No response from server</h1>
    <p>If you get the notification “No response from server” in the launcher. Look in the public
        discord. It’s possible that the launcher is having issues or the server is down. If so, do
        nothing with the launcher. Wait and things should resolve themselves. If server isn’t down and
        you’re getting this notice, make sure your time in queue is going up. If not restart the
        launcher. This should fix it. <br>
        Sometimes - the message may not go. If this is the case and your time in queue / position is
        still changing you should be fine. Sometimes you may need to restart launcher to get rid of the
        notice but it shouldn’t be a huge issue. <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If you restart the launcher it’s possible you will/may have already lost your spot
        in queue.</p>
