<div class="">
    <h1>Launcher too out of date or failed to update</h1>
    <p>Maybe you’ve been away for a short while and you’re trying to run the
        launcher. You’re then given an error of “Launcher is too out of date.” or “Launcher failed to
        update” <br>
        This is something fairly simple to fix. You can click <a href="https://thefamilyrp.com/utils/launcher/LauncherUpdater.exe">here</a> to download
        the LauncherUpdater.exe file again. Run it and it should force the launcher to update. You don’t
        need to delete the old files or uninstall the launcher to run it.</p>
