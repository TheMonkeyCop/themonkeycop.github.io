    <h1>DLC Files are missing or corrupt </h1>
    <p>
        This can happen when files become corrupted. To resolve this issue you need to verify your files.</p> For the steam version of GTA, you can verify the files by:<br>
    <ol>

        <li>Go onto your games library on steam</li>
        <li>Find Grand Theft Auto V on your steam library and right click it.</li>
        <li>Click Properties</li>
        <li>Go to the “local files” tab on the top</li>
        <li>Click “verify integrity of game files”</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This should check your files and download/re-download missing/corrupt files. If you do this and it doesn’t find anything, Select “Browse local files” delete “GTAVLauncher.exe” then verify again.</p> <br>
    For the Rockstar version of GTA you can verify the files by:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Hit "Start", "Run", and type "cmd" without the quotes. Hit enter.</li>
        <li>Type "cd c:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto V" without the quotes in the cmd window that pops up. Hit enter.</li>
        <b>Note:</b> If you have installed GTA in a different directory enter that instead. If you have it on a different drive letter. Change the drive by typing the drive letter and colon then entering it first.
        Example:- D:
        <li>Type "GTAVLauncher.exe -verify" in this window (no quotes again) and hit enter.</li>
    </ol>
