<div class="">
    <h1>Handshake failed </h1>
    <p>This can happen if the server is down, or due to bad connection. If you get this error firstly check discord to see if the server is down or not. If server is not down just close FiveM and click launch again. You do not need to close the launcher. <br>
        The fastest method to close FiveM is to press F8 - type “quit” and then press enter. </p>
