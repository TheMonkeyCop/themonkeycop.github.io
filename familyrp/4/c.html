<div class="">
    <h1>Stuck on passport screen </h1>
    <p>When you join the server you will get prompted with a screen to create a character or select your character. When you load sometimes it doesn’t always let you use your mouse. You may see just the map in the bottom right spin around. To fix this simply:<br>
        Press T (this will open the chat box) type “/login” (without the quotation marks) and press enter. This should release your mouse and allow you to select as you wish. </p>
