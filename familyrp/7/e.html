<div class="">
    <h1>I used my phone and now I can’t move. </h1>
    <p>This is due to the phone locking out your keyboard. This is done to prevent you moving while typing. <br>
        To release your keyboard back to the player use “end” and “backspace” this should release your controls and allow you to walk again. </p>
