<div class="">
    <h1>It won’t let me select my character </h1>
    <p>When you join the server you will get prompted with a screen to create a character or select your character.<br>
        When you load sometimes it doesn’t always let you use your mouse. You may see just the map in the bottom right spin around. To fix this simply:<br>
        Press T (this will open the chat box) type “/login” (without the quotation marks) and press enter. This should release your mouse and allow you to select as you wish. </p>
