<div class="">
    <h1>I have no/few clothing options </h1>
    <p>This is due to selecting a ped model. <br>
        You either have to deal with this or put in a request on the forum for your ped data resetting or if you don’t have the patience to wait for the request, create a new character with a similar name (as you can’t have 2 characters with the exact same name) and then use a “freemode” model. <br>
        If you put a request in on the forum. Post it under the game help section. <br>
        Remember to include the character ID number. </p>
