<div class="">
    <h1>I think I’m instanced. How can I tell? </h1>
    <p>If you feel you’re instanced you can hold the home button. In the bottom right it will say how many are online and the server uptime.
        If your “players online” says 1 that means you’re instanced. <br>
        If you are instanced, just relog (close FiveM and launch again. You should be fine.) </p>
